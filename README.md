# Java_Oracle_Installer
Bash script to Install or upgrade Java from Oracle using links for future upgrades

Warning this script is for jdk installations/upgrades only.

You must have first used this script to install a prior version of jdk before
using this to upgrade.

This will work for both 32-bit and 64-bit installations





First download the tarball from www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Place this script inside the same location and the tarball.
